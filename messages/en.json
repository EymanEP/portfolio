Since then, I've pursued a career in web development and currently work with frontend frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, as well as backend technologies like Spring Boot.\nOutside of work, I enjoy going to the gym, riding motorcycles, playing games, and going out with friends.\nI'm always eager to learn new tools or refine my existing skills.\nFeel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate!",
